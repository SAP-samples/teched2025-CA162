# Exercise 4: Secure Data Deletion

Important for data are retention periods enabled or delete data when they are not necessary anymore. Therfore, the last exercise is about deletion of data arrangements created **S/4HANA**, and data import as well as stories in **SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)**.

A reason for data deletion are mainly
- Purpose limitation: Keep data only for the specific purpose it was collected; delete when the purpose ends.
- Storage limitation and data minimization (e.g., GDPR): Retain no longer than necessary; reduce scope and duration to what’s needed.
- Accuracy and relevance: Delete outdated or inaccurate data to maintain data quality and fairness. 

Secure deletion of data in **SAC**

The created stories and data sets, will be available in "My Files" (thrid icon on the left side).
By selecting all stories and data sets those can be deleted with the "trash can"-symbol on the right corner (sixth icon on the right side).



Confirm the deletion of the data with "ok"
After the confirmation, the files are permantly deleted.
